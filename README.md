# üìä News-Category-Classifier - Effortless News Classification Made Simple

![Download from Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Release-4CAF50.svg)

## üìã Overview
News-Category-Classifier is an application designed to help you categorize news articles. Using advanced techniques, the application classifies news into four main categories: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. With a user-friendly interface, you can visualize and evaluate the classification results with ease.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To get started, follow these steps to download and run the software.

## üîó Download & Install
Visit this page to download: [News-Category-Classifier Releases](https://github.com/brhommmm/News-Category-Classifier/releases).

After downloading, you will find an executable file that you can run without any technical knowledge.  

## üíª System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux (Latest versions recommended)
- Memory: At least 4 GB RAM
- Disk Space: Minimum 500 MB of free space

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps
1. **Visit the Download Page:** Go to [News-Category-Classifier Releases](https://github.com/brhommmm/News-Category-Classifier/releases).
2. **Download the Executable:** Look for the latest version available and download the file.
3. **Locate the File:** After the download is complete, find the file in your downloads folder.
4. **Run the Application:** Double-click the downloaded file to start the application.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Automatically cleans and prepares text for classification.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts text into numerical data, enabling effective analysis.
- **Multiple Classifiers:** Trains both Logistic Regression and a Neural Network to improve accuracy.
- **Data Visualization:** Create visual representations of the results for better understanding.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the classifiers with clear metrics.

## üîç How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** The application utilizes the AG News dataset, a well-known source for news classification.
2. **Text Processing:** Before classification, the application preprocesses the text by removing unnecessary elements, such as punctuation and stop words.
3. **Classification Models:** You can choose between two models‚ÄîLogistic Regression and Neural Network‚Äîto classify text.
4. **Result Visualization:** Once classification is done, the application presents results through clean visualizations.

## üé® Visual Examples
The application includes tools to create word clouds and charts, which can help you see trends and patterns in the classified news articles.
